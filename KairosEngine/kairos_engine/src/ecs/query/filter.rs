/// Types that filter the results of a [`Query`].
///
/// There are many types that natively implement this trait:
/// - **Component filters.**
///   [`With`] and [`Without`] filters can be applied to check if the queried entity does or does not contain a particular component.
/// - **Change detection filters.**
///   [`Added`] and [`Changed`] filters can be applied to detect component changes to an entity.
/// - **Spawned filter.**
///   [`Spawned`] filter can be applied to check if the queried entity was spawned recently.
/// - **`QueryFilter` tuples.**
///   If every element of a tuple implements `QueryFilter`, then the tuple itself also implements the same trait.
///   This enables a single `Query` to filter over multiple conditions.
///   Due to the current lack of variadic generics in Rust, the trait has been implemented for tuples from 0 to 15 elements,
///   but nesting of tuples allows infinite `QueryFilter`s.
/// - **Filter disjunction operator.**
///   By default, tuples compose query filters in such a way that all conditions must be satisfied to generate a query item for a given entity.
///   Wrapping a tuple inside an [`Or`] operator will relax the requirement to just one condition.
///
/// Implementing the trait manually can allow for a fundamentally new type of behavior.
///
/// Query design can be easily structured by deriving `QueryFilter` for custom types.
/// Despite the added complexity, this approach has several advantages over using `QueryFilter` tuples.
/// The most relevant improvements are:
///
/// - Reusability across multiple systems.
/// - Filters can be composed together to create a more complex filter.
///
/// This trait can only be derived for structs if each field also implements `QueryFilter`.
